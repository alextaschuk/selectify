# Selectify- A Random Album Selector for Spotify

**Log in with Spotify and have a random album be chosen from your saved albums list to listen to**

This summer (2023), I wanted to teach myself Python and complete a project that would have a real-life application to gain a better understanding of fullstack development. As a result, Selectify was created.

For more information about the development of Selectify, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ataschuk/selectify/wiki) of this repo.
